"This also means that any form of harassment or other behaviour that makes "
"people uncomfortable has no place at CryptoParties. In our experience "
"situations like these (as seldom as they occur) stem rather from social "
"ineptitude than malice and can thus be resolved by making people aware of "
"their behaviour and its effect on others, but in last consequence it is on "
"the organizers of the CryptoParty to ask people to leave if they don't "
"adhere to this very simple rule. Be excellent to each other. Awareness is "
"key in this regard."

"you are uncertain if what you have in mind is on topic or if other people "

"say. If you are too shy to propose to the whole room: Ask the person "

"How To is written to give you some ideas on what might work and what not so "

"A CryptoParty cannot teach you everything there is to know about computer "
"and internet security in one evening. Main objective is to tear down the "
"mental walls which prohibit people to even think about these topics or pick "
"them up as they occur throughout their lives, like in newspaper articles, "
"blog posts, educational pictures and memes. There is plenty of information "
"about computer and internet security out there. Sadly, many people don't "
"consider themselves able to process it and don't even start. That's what we "
"want to change. Take away the fear of cryptic and technical things (two "
"properties inherent to cryptographic tools) so they can continue educating "
"themselves and others."

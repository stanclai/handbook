"Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to "
"be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of "
"Association and Freedom of Speech. Simply put, privacy is the border where "
"we draw a line between how far a society can intrude into our personal lives."

"Countries differ in how they define privacy. In the UK for example, privacy "
"laws can be traced back to the 1300s when the English monarchy created laws "
"protecting people from eavesdroppers and peeping toms. These regulations "
"referred to the intrusion of a personâ€™s comfort and not even the King of "
"England could enter into a poor persons house without their permission. From "
"this perspective, privacy is defined in terms of personal space and private "
"property. In 1880 American lawyers, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis "
"described privacy as the 'right to be left alone'. In this case, privacy is "
"synonymous with notions of solitude and the right for a private life. In "
"1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifically protected "
"territorial and communications privacy which by that became part of "
"constitutions worldwide. The European Commission on Human Rights and the "
"European Court of Human Rights also noted in 1978 that privacy encompasses "
"the right to establish relationships with others and develop emotional well-"
"being."

"Today, a further facet of privacy increasingly perceived is the personal "
"data we provide to organizations, online as well as offline. How our "
"personal data is used and accessed drives the debate about the laws that "
"govern our behavior and society. This in turn has knock-on effects on the "
"public services we access and how businesses interact with us.  It even has "
"effects on how we define ourselves. If privacy is about the borders which "
"govern who we give permission to watch us and track aspects of our lives, "
"then the amount and type of personal information gathered, disseminated and "
"processed is paramount to our basic civil liberties."

"An often heard argument, when questions of privacy and anonymity come up, "
"goes along the lines of, \"I only do boring stuff. Nobody will be interested "
"in it anyway\" or, \"I have nothing to hide\". Both of these statements are "
"easily defeated."

"Firstly, a lot of companies are very interested in what boring things you do "
"precisely so they have opportunity to offer \"excellent\" products fitting "
"interests. In this way their advertising becomes much more efficient - they "
"are able to tailor specifically to assumed needs and desires. Secondly you "
"do have lots to hide. Maybe you do not express it in explicitly stated "
"messages to friends and colleagues, but your browsing - if not protected by "
"the techniques laid out in this book - will tell a lot about things you "
"might rather keep secret: the ex-partner you search for using Google, "
"illnesses you research or movies you watch are just few examples."

"Another consideration is that just because you might not have something to "
"hide at this moment, you may very well in future. Putting together all the "
"tools and skills to protect yourself from surveillance takes practice, trust "
"and a bit of effort. These are things you might not be able to achieve and "
"configure right when you need them most and need not take the form of a spy "
"movie. An obsessed, persistent stalker, for example, is enough to heavily "
"disrupt your life. The more you follow the suggestions given in this book, "
"the less impact attacks like this will have on you. Companies may also stalk "
"you too, finding more and more ways to reach into your daily life as the "
"reach of computer networking itself deepens."

"Finally, a lack of anonymity and privacy does not just affect you, but all "
"the people around you. If a third party, like your Internet Service "
"Provider, reads your email, it is also violating the privacy of all the "
"people in your address book. This problem starts to look even more dramatic "
"when you look at the issues of social networking websites like Facebook.  It "
"is increasingly common to see photos uploaded and tagged without the "
"knowledge or permission of the people affected."

"While we encourage you to be active politically to maintain your right to "
"privacy, we wrote this book in order to empower people who feel that "
"maintaining privacy on the Internet is also a personal responsibility. We "
"hope these chapters will help you reach a point where you can feel that you "
"have some control over how much other people know about you. Each of us has "
"the right to a private life, a right to explore, browse and communicate with "
"others as one wishes, without living in fear of prying eyes."

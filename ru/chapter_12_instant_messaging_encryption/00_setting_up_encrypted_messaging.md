All OS - crypto.cat
-------------------

[https://crypto.cat](https://crypto.cat)

Cryptocat is an open source web application intended to allow secure, encrypted online chatting. Cryptocat encrypts chats on the client side, only trusting the server with data that is already encrypted. Cryptocat is delivered as a browser extension and offers plugins for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari.

Cryptocat intends to provide means for impromptu, encrypted communications that offer more privacy than services such as Google Talk, while maintaining a higher level of accessibility than other high-level encryption platforms, and furthermore allows for multiple users in one chat room.

Chat Log Files
--------------

Some of the Chat Clients listed above e.g. Adium, store plaintext, unencrypted Chat Logs, often by default, even when the OTR "security / privacy" plug-in is installed.

If you are taking OTR precautions to protect your chats from snoopers over the wire or over the air, you should either double check that you have manually switched off Chat Session Logging, or ensure that the Chat Logs you deliberately intend to keep are created on an encrypted disk drive or volume, in case your computer is lost, stolen or seized. It is also worth asking the person you are chatting with if they are inadvertently logging the chat with their own Chat Client software.
